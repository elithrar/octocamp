### Who am I?

I'm Matt. I work as an ICT Engineer & photographer. I'm big on travel, streets & landscapes, so you'll see a lot of those things on this blog. When I'm not taking photos I'm reading, writing and/or planning my next trip somewhere.

### What do I use?

I started with a Nikon D80, sold my 5D Mark II some time ago, dabbled with a Panasonic GF1 and now shoot exclusively with a [Fuji X100](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=eatsleeprepea-20). It's small, it doesn't need a dedicated bag, has full manual controls and the 35mm effective field-of-view is spot on for how I like to frame shots. Everything else is superfluousâ€”I'd rather take photographs than worry about more lenses or extra bodies.

I also have a couple of 35mm rangefinders (in varying states of repair) that I use on occasion, and am usually putting Fuji Pro 400H, Superia 800 or Ilford HP5 through them.

### Best way to contact me?
