### Who am I?

I'm Matt, and I'm an engineer, programmer and photographer. I'm big on travel, streets & landscapes, so you'll see a lot of those things on this blog. When I'm not taking photos I'm building something, reading and/or planning my next trip somewhere.

### What do I use?

I started with a Nikon D80, sold my 5D Mark II some time ago, dabbled with a Panasonic GF1 and now shoot exclusively with a [Fuji X100](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=eatsleeprepea-20). It's small, it doesn't need a dedicated bag, has full manual controls and the 35mm effective field-of-view is spot on for how I like to frame shots. Everything else is superfluous—I'd rather take photographs than worry about more lenses or extra bodies.

I've also been shooting film a fair bit—I've never been one to take 50 shots a day—because it's hard to go past the look. I'm currently shooting with a Nikon F3HP, but have a Yashica Electro 35 I pull out on occassion. Fuji Pro 400H, Portra 400 and Kodak Tri-X are my staples.

### Best way to contact me?
