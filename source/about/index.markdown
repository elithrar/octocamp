### Who am I?

I'm Matt Silverlock. I'm an ICT Engineer, working for a consultancy here in Perth, WA. I'm currently finishing off a degree in Internetworking and Security. I also take a lot of photos, code for the web, have more than a passing interest in application/network security, and read less than I should.

### What do I use?

My most prized possession is my [Fuji X100](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=eatsleeprepea-20), which replaced a Panasonic GF1 (and before that, a 5D Mark II). I shoot a lot of street, landscape and editorial content, and need a camera that can be at my side every day. It doesn't need a dedicated bag, and the 35mm effective field-of-view is spot on for how I like to frame shots. Everything else is superfluousâ€”I'd rather take photographs than worry about more lenses or extra bodies.

### Read?

Sure do. My favorite book is [The Rose Grower](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0553381210/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=eatsleeprepea-20) by Michelle de Kretser, followed (pretty damned) closely by the [A Song of Ice and Fire](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0345529057/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=eatsleeprepea-20) series (aka "Game of Thrones"). I highly suggest reading both.
