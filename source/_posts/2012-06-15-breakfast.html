<p>At Food for Me in Victoria Park, Perth. Their Eggs Benedict is fantastic: the hollandaise isn't too sweet, the eggs are poached perfectly and their mango chutney is delectableâ€”although I did forget to order them with smoked salmon. Em had the french toast w/ maple syrup, berries and bacon.</p>
