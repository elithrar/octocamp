Picked up another rangefinder—this time, a Yashica Electro 35 GSN. I discovered that my Minolta needed more than just new seals—it has a faulty self-timer that has jammed the shutter—and figured that was as good an excuse as any to add to my collection. I also wanted something that wasn't going to fail me when I'm in Melbourne next month on holiday.

The Yashica itself is a little simpler than the Minolta, despite the busy-looking top plate. It's aperture priority only, but will do anywhere between 1/500 and 30s. The viewfinder will show when the camera can't keep the shutter in that range for the selected aperture, and the frame-lines are nice and bright. Looking forward to giving it a run this weekend.
