Discovered a neat little waffle place called [Superstar Waffles](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/338/1686816/restaurant/Perth/Superstar-Waffles-Northbridge) here in Northbridge. Had a latte (good!) and shared a few bites from a waffle-on-a-stick with condensed milk (great!). I'm definitely a fan.

The store itself is very minimalist, from the iPad-as-the-till down to the spartan tables and chairs. It's cozy, too, so plan to avoid usual busy periods or get something to go.
