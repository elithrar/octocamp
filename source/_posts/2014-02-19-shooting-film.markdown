I picked up a [Nikon F3HP](http://www.flickr.com/photos/elithrar/12577451324/) recently to complement my Fuji X100, with the goal of taking it to Japan with me in April where I plan to shoot 90% film. I ran a roll of Fuji Pro 400H through it (at box speed) within a day to check that the seals and shutter were working as expected, and picked up the results this morning. This one was my favorite from the set, and after a quick +2/3EV adjustment I couldn't be more pleased. I'll likely shoot my next batch of 400H at ISO250 since the colors respond so well to it.
