Decided we needed a weekend away after a busy first half of the year after balancing moving, study and work. We stayed at Yallingup Beach Holiday Park—Em's favorite spot down in Yallingup—for three nights. It's also 50m from the beach, which is just about as close as you can get without being in the ocean. Waking up to the crashing of waves was always a good way to start the day.

What did we get up to? In no particular order, we walked along the beach, took a few photos, ate cheese kranksy's and hash browns, devoured the fruit bread and sourdough from the [Yallingup Woodfired Bakery](http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/348/1542382/restaurant/Western-Australia/Yallingup-Woodfired-Bakery-Dunsborough), and went for a quick drive in the winter cold to shoot some stars.

Not bad for two-and-a-half hours from Perth.
