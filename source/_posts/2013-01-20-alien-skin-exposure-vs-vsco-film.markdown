During downtime or during periods where I've lacked a bit of motivation to go out and shoot, editing old photos and/or trying out some new post-processing techniques has often given me some inspiration to get out there again.

My process has always been fairly manual. Import into LR, fix any WB/exposure/highlight issues, apply a hand-crafted preset for some basic colour correction/vignetting/etc and then push the image into Photoshop + Alien Skin Exposure ("Exposure") and apply a film preset. I typically set my preferred presets as actions in PS so I can hit a couple of keyboard shortcuts and end up back in Lightroom with a neatly stacked TIFF image on top of the original RAW one. It's not the smoothest workflow, but the results are hard to beat.

Still, it's always worth shopping around on occasion to see what else is out there. I've always been impressed by a lot of photographers who use VSCO Film, and decided to dedicate my Sunday morning to comparing VSCO's film presets (VSCO 01 & VSCO 02 for LR4) with Exposure's. 

Note that I have historically used Fuji Astia (color; I love the real thing) and Kodak Tri-X (B+W; great grain) emulations for most of my shots, but have been leaning towards Fuji 400H (a great neutral film) and Ilford HP5 (finer grain than Tri-X). Exposure and VSCO Film both have these on offer, so I've compared their Pro 400H, HP5, Tri-X and Provia 160VC emulations. Images were edited beforehand w/ WB/tint set identically. Any obvious differences in hue are the results of the emulation only. Large (1920px) versions are available if you click through—you'll probably want to look at them if you want to examine the grain.

#### Fuji 400H

I've really taken a liking to 400H recently—so much so that I bought a few rolls of the real stuff today (in 35mm format) with a near-mint Minolta Hi-Matic 9 rangefinder. It has such great tones, and I've had problems pulling myself away from a couple of [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/groups/1084764@N20/pool/) [group](http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?w=481987%40N24&m=pool&q=400H) pools.

Exposure definitely feels more vibrant here—the VSCO image has an odd tint to it.

This is a tough call. The VSCO image is slightly warmer (channeling some Portra, I feel) but Exposure's rendition is a little more "honest". The skin tones in Exposure's take are definitely more natural.

#### Portra 160VC

I've compared Portra 160VC as Exposure doesn't have a Portra 400 emulation, and it'd be remiss to not include Portra given its popularity.

[![Portra 160VC](http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_portra_160vc_thumb.jpg)](http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_portra_160vc.jpg)

Big difference here. I feel the actual film [lies somewhere in between](http://www.flickr.com/groups/kodak_portra_160vc/pool/), as Exposure's take is much more saturated.

Exposure here, for sure. Looks more like Portra 160VC and has more "pop" to it.  The VSCO take isn't bad though, and there's no doubt plenty of people would prefer the less saturated take. I'm not huge on pushing saturation up, but I do like "enough".

#### Ilford HP5

I've always had a tough time deciding between HP5 and Tri-X. HP5 is a bit finer grained, but Tri-X has great blacks. Note that the "original" Tri-X (which these emulations feel like) isn't available anymore; Kodak changed the formula and re-branded it "400TX". The grain is a tad finer in the new stuff, but I digress.

[![Ilford HP5](http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5_thumb.jpg)](http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5.jpg)

Tricky. VSCO is brighter, but the Exposure take has better blacks. I'd say that the Exposure image could probably do with a slight exposure push to compensate a little more. The VSCO image doesn't have nice grain (this is a problem with a number of their emulations; grain is very pattern-like).

[![Ilford HP5](http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5_2_thumb.jpg)](http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5_2.jpg)

I've compensated the Exposure shot a little—with a 10% opacity grey exclusion layer in PS—as VSCO gets to overwrite my own curve adjustments in Lightroom. It's not a totally fair comparison as a result, but it lifts the blacks and really helps show the detail. VSCO's black-and-white emulations are much flatter than real film, but this is also part of the attraction (and I like this look sometimes) for a lot of photographers. This could go either way, but I feel her eyes have more depth in Exposure's take and the grain (again) is more organic.

#### Kodak Tri-X

It's Tri-X. Most my black & white work over the last six months uses this.

[![Kodak Tri-X](http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_trix_400_thumb.jpg)](http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_trix_400.jpg)

Again, it's a tough call. *I* like the contrast in Exposure's Tri-X emulation, and I think it's much more like "[the real thing](http://www.flickr.com/groups/tri-x/pool/)", but realism isn't always the goal. VSCO's grain here is actually (surprisingly) good for once, and I'd say it's the pick of the VSCO crop.

#### Wrap-up

Exposure's results are more pleasing to me, and in cases where I need to lift blacks or flatten things out I have more leeway to do so (that, and I'm already in Photoshop...). As aforementioned, it's Exposure's grain that really puts in ahead in my books: VSCO's grain "scans" are too static. Many of us use film emulations for the grain, and nailing that is important.

Both are about the same price: Exposure is [$199](https://app.alienskin.com/store/) and VSCO Film is [$119 per pack](http://visualsupply.co/store). Film 02 has updated Portra presets; Film 01 has Pro 400H and Tri-X (I'd buy 01, personally). VSCO has a neat little preset "toolkit" for tinting shadows, highlights and making other minor tweaks, and ultimately is more friendly to use as a result. Exposure has a *lot* of other emulations (Kodachrome!), and offers a lot of choice (too much?) for those who want that.

It's a tough call. VSCO really makes your workflow easy: fix first, hit the preset and tweak if needed. Exposure is a bit clunkier and you end up with 100MB+ TIFFs eating up some space (even if space is cheap these days), although Lightroom automatic stacking makes this a minor issue overall. But Exposure's advantages—nicer grain, more natural saturation and more "pop" (however you quantify that)—outweigh the negatives.
