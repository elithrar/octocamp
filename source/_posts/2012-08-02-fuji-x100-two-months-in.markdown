Okay: I've had the [X100](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=eatsleeprepea-20) for three months now and I feel it's time to add a few things to my [original review](http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/fuji-x100-review/).

First up: the RAW files. They're great, and there's a *lot* of latitude in them. I pushed a bunch of files from the [Say Anything](http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/say-anything/) gig I went to—which I shot at ISO3200—a minimum of one stop and saw very little chroma (color) noise. What noise there was had a great "film" look, and pushing the files around with my usual Lightroom > Alien Skin Exposure > Photoshop workflow didn't cause any problems. I'm still comfortably leaving the X100 set to ISO800/1000 on a daily basis (and using the ND to control shutter speed), without the need to worry about dull colors or ugly/distracting noise.

The battery life has been rock solid. There are some who seem to believe it has a sub-par battery life—and I guess if you're coming from an pro-grade DSLR, then it may seem bad in comparison—but it manages weeks on standby with more than a handful of shots in-between. It also coped with four days away when I went to [Yallingup](http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/yallingup/) in July—the spare batteries I brought down with me never saw any use (it was still near-full almost a week later). It might be the fact that I review sparingly and rely on the OVF that contributes to this—I'm not the kind to "spray and pray". 

Reliability-wise, it hasn't locked up once. I've had firmware v1.30 on it since day zero, so that may have something to do with it, but I've never had to pop the battery out to reset the camera. It's almost managed to avoid any real dings or scratches, despite living sans-case in an inside pocket of my messenger bag. I have a JJC filter adapter ring and a [silver B+W UV filter](http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/622143-REG/B_W_66_042015_66_042015_49mm_Digital_Pro.html) on it; I don't use the hood as it adds too much depth. I not usually one to run with a UV filter on my cameras, but the X100 is the exception: it's an every-day, always-there tool, and any damage to the lens means the whole camera is out of action. I just made sure to buy a decent filter to minimise any added ghosting or flare, and so far I haven't had any problems.

The LCD could probably be a bit better (higher-res), and I have started to bump the AF mode dial on the front a bit more than I'd like. Part of that is attributed to the fact that it lives in my messenger bag (sans-case) and/or the cup-holder in my car, and therefore is outright more prone to being knocked. I've gotten used to the rear dial, but it's still a bit fiddly. Can't do much about that though—and it doesn't hugely impact the usability of the camera.

The [Gordy's](http://www.gordyscamerastraps.com/neck-string-double/index.htm) strap (string; double attach; 50") that I picked up for it is still going strong, too. Matches the X100 well and is just long enough to sling bandolier-style over my body—but long enough that I can still pull the viewfinder up to my eye comfortably.

I'm still loving the OVF—even more as time goes on. I'm forever liking the frame-lines and what is effectively "greater than 100%" frame coverage. I do occasionally flick it over to the EVF if I really need to nail a composition—or something close—but the other 90% of the time I'm using the OVF. It takes maybe a week to get used to the accuracy of the framelines vs. the distance of what you're shooting (and therefore your composition)—but after that it's smooth sailing.

The more time I spend with the X100 the more I know I made the right choice. There's no buyer's remorse here, despite considering the NEX-7 (unexciting RAW files; expensive with the 24mm), OM-D (too SLR-like), and the X-Pro 1 (just that bit too big). I can comfortably "see" in 35mm, which means I can almost frame a shot before lifting the camera to my eye. It's never intrusive at dinner tables, in the car, or over my shoulder on long walks. It rarely struggles in less-than-ideal lighting, excels in good light, and gives me the control I want; all of these things are exactly what I was after. It's almost a shame I waited so long to buy one.
