Okay, I've had the [X100](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=eatsleeprepea-20) for two months now and I feel it's time to add a few things to my [original review](http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/fuji-x100-review/).

The battery life has been rock solid. There are some who seem to believe it has a sub-par battery life—and I guess if you're coming from an FF DSLR, then it may seem bad in comparison—but it manages weeks on standby with the odd shot in-between. And it managed a full four days away when I went to [Yallingup](http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/yallingup/) in July—the spare batteries I brought down with me never saw any use.

Reliability-wise, it hasn't locked up once. I've had firmware v1.30 on it since day zero, so that may have something to do with it, but I've never had to pop the battery out.

The LCD could probably be a bit better (higher-res), and I have started to bump the AF mode dial on the front a bit more than I'd like, but part of that is attributed to the fact that it lives in my messenger bag (sans-case) and/or the cup-holder in my car, and therefore is outright more prone to being knocked.

The [Gordy's](http://www.gordyscamerastraps.com/neck-string-double/index.htm) strap (string; double attach; 50") that I picked up for it is still going strong, too. Matches the X100 well and is just long enough to sling bandolier-style over my body—but long enough that I can still pull the viewfinder up to my eye comfortably.
