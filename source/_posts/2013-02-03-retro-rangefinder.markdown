I managed to score this Minolta Hi-Matic 9 for $60 on eBay a couple of weeks ago, and it arrived this Friday just past. The body is in great condition—with the odd few scratches you'd expect from something 50 years old—and it seems to have a working shutter (some of these Minolta's have a rep for sticky shutters). The light seals are completely shot, so I'll be replacing them this week with yarn & felt, and I have a few rolls of Fuji 400H & Ilford HP5 that should hopefully arrive shortly.

Fingers crossed that it works!
