    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I picked up a <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/elithrar/12577451324/">Nikon F3HP</a> recently to complement my Fuji X100, with the goal of taking it to Japan with me in April where I plan to shoot 90% film. I ran a roll of Fuji Pro 400H through it (at box speed) within a day to check that the seals and shutter were working as expected, and picked up the results this morning. This one was my favorite from the set, and after a quick +2/3EV adjustment I couldn&#8217;t be more pleased. I&#8217;ll likely shoot my next batch of 400H at ISO250 since the colors respond so well to it.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I take a ton of photos on my iPhone, and I&#8217;ve always tried to keep my workflow as simple as possible: no multiple app import/export shenanigans. For a long while I was using the original VSCO Cam app—I loved the filters but wasn&#8217;t a fan of the slowness. <a href="http://afterlight.us/">Afterlight</a> (formerly Afterglow) came along and solved a lot of the problems I had with VSCO&#8217;s interface, even if the filters weren&#8217;t as great (I value convenience highly when using my phone!).</p>

<p>So you can imagine I was pretty impressed when the new <a href="http://vsco.co/vscocam">VSCO Cam</a> launched a couple of weeks ago; alongside a whole raft of new filters, a much improved UI (with a few quirks) and significantly better performance. Note that if you&#8217;re going to buy any of the preset packs, it currently makes a lot of sense to cough up $5.99 for all 48 presets. Given that the app itself costs nothing, it&#8217;s money well invested.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been using it non-stop since I got it. Most of the below use the &#8220;F&#8221; and &#8220;K&#8221; presets, which are easily my favorites so far for their relatively muted look.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just came back from a quick four-day trip in Melbourne. The weather was great—having just missed the end of their heatwave—and we spent most of our time shopping, eating, walking &amp; taking photos. I&#8217;d been before (about four years ago), and it&#8217;s easy to forget how much more &#8220;alive&#8221; the city is than Perth. Even at 8PM at night you&#8217;re spoilt for choice, and you don&#8217;t feel unsafe walking down the streets between dinner and dessert.</p>

<p>The highlights were <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1721982/restaurant/Melbourne/Shawcross-Pizza-Fitzroy">Shawcross Pizza</a> in Fitzroy, who offered some of the best NY-style pizza we&#8217;ve had; <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1474868/restaurant/CBD/The-Hardware-Societe-Melbourne">The Hardware Societé</a> in the CBD, with an incredible chorizo &amp; tomato baked egg breakfast (Em had french toast w/ a poached pear &amp; hazelnut praline); and <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1631746/restaurant/CBD/Snag-Stand-Melbourne">The Snag Stand</a> with amazing cheese kransky, sriracha mayonnaise &amp; cheese on brioche &#8216;dogs.</p>

<p>Fitzroy was easily our favorite place to eat and explore—you can walk forever and find new places you haven&#8217;t seen or visited. We ended up taking cabs ($11 from the CBD) instead of trams there most of the time, and I think the next trip will have us staying in Fitzroy if we can manage it. If I had the option to move here, I&#8217;d do it in a heartbeat.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Picked up another rangefinder—this time, a Yashica Electro 35 GSN. I discovered that my Minolta needed more than just new seals—it has a faulty self-timer that has jammed the shutter—and figured that was as good an excuse as any to add to my collection. I also wanted something that wasn&#8217;t going to fail me when I&#8217;m in Melbourne next month on holiday.</p>

<p>The Yashica itself is a little simpler than the Minolta, despite the busy-looking top plate. It&#8217;s aperture priority only, but will do anywhere between 1/500 and 30s. The viewfinder will show when the camera can&#8217;t keep the shutter in that range for the selected aperture, and the frame-lines are nice and bright. Looking forward to giving it a run this weekend.</p>

The body is in great condition—with the odd few scratches you&#8217;d expect from something 50 years old—and it seems to have a working shutter (some of these Minolta&#8217;s have a rep for sticky shutters). The light seals are completely shot, so I&#8217;ll be replacing them this week with yarn &amp; felt, and I have a few rolls of Fuji 400H &amp; Ilford HP5 that should hopefully arrive shortly.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed that it works!</p>

    <link href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/alien-skin-exposure-vs-vsco-film/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-20T10:36:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/alien-skin-exposure-vs-vsco-film</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During downtime or during periods where I&#8217;ve lacked a bit of motivation to go out and shoot, editing old photos and/or trying out some new post-processing techniques has often given me some inspiration to get out there again.</p>

<p>My process has always been fairly manual. Import into LR, fix any WB/exposure/highlight issues, apply a hand-crafted preset for some basic colour correction/vignetting/etc and then push the image into Photoshop + Alien Skin Exposure (&#8220;Exposure&#8221;) and apply a film preset. I typically set my preferred presets as actions in PS so I can hit a couple of keyboard shortcuts and end up back in Lightroom with a neatly stacked TIFF image on top of the original RAW one. It&#8217;s not the smoothest workflow, but the results are hard to beat.</p>

<p>Still, it&#8217;s always worth shopping around on occasion to see what else is out there. I&#8217;ve always been impressed by a lot of photographers who use VSCO Film, and decided to dedicate my Sunday morning to comparing VSCO&#8217;s film presets (VSCO 01 &amp; VSCO 02 for LR4) with Exposure&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Note that I have historically used Fuji Astia (color; I love the real thing) and Kodak Tri-X (B+W; great grain) emulations for most of my shots, but have been leaning towards Fuji 400H (a great neutral film) and Ilford HP5 (finer grain than Tri-X). Exposure and VSCO Film both have these on offer, so I&#8217;ve compared their Pro 400H, HP5, Tri-X and Provia 160VC emulations. Images were edited beforehand w/ WB/tint set identically. Any obvious differences in hue are the results of the emulation only. Large (1920px) versions are available if you click through—you&#8217;ll probably want to look at them if you want to examine the grain.</p>

<h4>Fuji 400H</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve really taken a liking to 400H recently—so much so that I bought a few rolls of the real stuff today (in 35mm format) with a near-mint Minolta Hi-Matic 9 rangefinder. It has such great tones, and I&#8217;ve had problems pulling myself away from a couple of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1084764@N20/pool/">Flickr</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?w=481987%40N24&amp;m=pool&amp;q=400H">group</a> pools.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_fuji_400h.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_fuji_400h_thumb.jpg" alt="Fuji 400H" /></a></p>

<p>Exposure definitely feels more vibrant here—the VSCO image has an odd tint to it.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_fuji_400h_2.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_fuji_400h_2_thumb.jpg" alt="Fuji 400H" /></a></p>

<p>This is a tough call. The VSCO image is slightly warmer (channeling some Portra, I feel) but Exposure&#8217;s rendition is a little more &#8220;honest&#8221;. The skin tones in Exposure&#8217;s take are definitely more natural.</p>

<h4>Portra 160VC</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve compared Portra 160VC as Exposure doesn&#8217;t have a Portra 400 emulation, and it&#8217;d be remiss to not include Portra given its popularity.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_portra_160vc.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_portra_160vc_thumb.jpg" alt="Portra 160VC" /></a></p>

<p>Big difference here. I feel the actual film <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/kodak_portra_160vc/pool/">lies somewhere in between</a>, as Exposure&#8217;s take is much more saturated.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_portra_160vc_2.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_portra_160vc_2_thumb.jpg" alt="Portra 160VC" /></a></p>

<p>Exposure here, for sure. Looks more like Portra 160VC and has more &#8220;pop&#8221; to it.  The VSCO take isn&#8217;t bad though, and there&#8217;s no doubt plenty of people would prefer the less saturated take. I&#8217;m not huge on pushing saturation up, but I do like &#8220;enough&#8221;.</p>

<h4>Ilford HP5</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve always had a tough time deciding between HP5 and Tri-X. HP5 is a bit finer grained, but Tri-X has great blacks. Note that the &#8220;original&#8221; Tri-X (which these emulations feel like) isn&#8217;t available anymore; Kodak changed the formula and re-branded it &#8220;400TX&#8221;. The grain is a tad finer in the new stuff, but I digress.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5_thumb.jpg" alt="Ilford HP5" /></a></p>

<p>Tricky. VSCO is brighter, but the Exposure take has better blacks. I&#8217;d say that the Exposure image could probably do with a slight exposure push to compensate a little more. The VSCO image doesn&#8217;t have nice grain (this is a problem with a number of their emulations; grain is very pattern-like).</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5_2.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5_2_thumb.jpg" alt="Ilford HP5" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve compensated the Exposure shot a little—with a 10% opacity grey exclusion layer in PS—as VSCO gets to overwrite my own curve adjustments in Lightroom. It&#8217;s not a totally fair comparison as a result, but it lifts the blacks and really helps show the detail. VSCO&#8217;s black-and-white emulations are much flatter than real film, but this is also part of the attraction (and I like this look sometimes) for a lot of photographers. This could go either way, but I feel her eyes have more depth in Exposure&#8217;s take and the grain (again) is more organic.</p>

<h4>Kodak Tri-X</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s Tri-X. Most my black &amp; white work over the last six months uses this.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_trix_400.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_trix_400_thumb.jpg" alt="Kodak Tri-X" /></a></p>

<p>Again, it&#8217;s a tough call. <em>I</em> like the contrast in Exposure&#8217;s Tri-X emulation, and I think it&#8217;s much more like &#8221;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/tri-x/pool/">the real thing</a>&#8221;, but realism isn&#8217;t always the goal. VSCO&#8217;s grain here is actually (surprisingly) good for once, and I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s the pick of the VSCO crop.</p>

<h4>Wrap-up</h4>

<p>Exposure&#8217;s results are more pleasing to me, and in cases where I need to lift blacks or flatten things out I have more leeway to do so (that, and I&#8217;m already in Photoshop&#8230;). As aforementioned, it&#8217;s Exposure&#8217;s grain that really puts in ahead in my books: VSCO&#8217;s grain &#8220;scans&#8221; are too static. Many of us use film emulations for the grain, and nailing that is important.</p>

<p>Both are about the same price: Exposure is <a href="https://app.alienskin.com/store/">$199</a> and VSCO Film is <a href="http://visualsupply.co/store">$119 per pack</a>. Film 02 has updated Portra presets; Film 01 has Pro 400H and Tri-X (I&#8217;d buy 01, personally). VSCO has a neat little preset &#8220;toolkit&#8221; for tinting shadows, highlights and making other minor tweaks, and ultimately is more friendly to use as a result. Exposure has a <em>lot</em> of other emulations (Kodachrome!), and offers a lot of choice (too much?) for those who want that.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a tough call. VSCO really makes your workflow easy: fix first, hit the preset and tweak if needed. Exposure is a bit clunkier and you end up with 100MB+ TIFFs eating up some space (even if space is cheap these days), although Lightroom automatic stacking makes this a minor issue overall. But Exposure&#8217;s advantages—nicer grain, more natural saturation and more &#8220;pop&#8221; (however you quantify that)—outweigh the negatives.</p>

    <link href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/fuji-x100-three-months-in/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-04T08:07:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/fuji-x100-three-months-in</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eatsleeprepea-20">X100</a> for three months now, and I feel it&#8217;s time to add a few things to my <a href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/fuji-x100-review/">original review</a>. This review will be a little more technical than the first, but there (still) won&#8217;t be any pixel peeping here.</p>

<p>First up: the RAW files. They&#8217;re great, and there&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> of latitude in them. I pushed a bunch of files from the <a href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/say-anything/">Say Anything</a> gig I went to—which I shot at ISO3200—a minimum of one stop and saw very little chroma (colour) noise. What noise there was had a great &#8220;film&#8221; look, and pushing the files around with my usual Lightroom + Photoshop + Alien Skin Exposure workflow didn&#8217;t cause any problems. I&#8217;m still comfortably leaving the X100 set to ISO800/1000 on a daily basis (and using the ND filter to control shutter speed), without the need to worry about dull colours or ugly/distracting noise.</p>

<p>The battery life has been rock solid. There are some who seem to believe it has a sub-par battery life—and I guess if you&#8217;re coming from an pro-grade DSLR, then it may seem bad in comparison—but it manages weeks on standby with a good handful of shots in-between. It also coped with four days away when I went to <a href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/yallingup/">Yallingup</a> in July—the spare batteries I brought down with me never saw any use (it was still near-full almost a week later). It might be the fact that I review sparingly and spend most of my time using the OVF that contributes to this—I&#8217;m not the kind to &#8220;spray and pray&#8221;.</p>

<p>Reliability-wise, it hasn&#8217;t locked up once. I&#8217;ve had firmware v1.30 on it since day zero, so that may have something to do with it, but I&#8217;ve never had to pop the battery out to reset the camera. It&#8217;s almost managed to avoid any real dings or scratches, despite living sans-case in an inside pocket of my messenger bag. I have a JJC filter adapter ring and a <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/622143-REG/B_W_66_042015_66_042015_49mm_Digital_Pro.html">silver B+W UV filter</a> on it; I don&#8217;t use the hood as it adds too much depth. I not usually one to run with a UV filter on my cameras, but the X100 is the exception: it&#8217;s an every-day, always-there tool, and any damage to the lens means the whole camera is out of action. I just made sure to buy a decent filter to minimise any added ghosting or flare, and so far I haven&#8217;t had any problems.</p>

<p>The LCD could probably be a bit better (higher-res), and I have started to bump the AF mode dial on the front a bit more than I&#8217;d like. Part of that is attributed to the fact that it lives in my messenger bag (sans-case) and/or the cup-holder in my car, and therefore is outright more prone to being knocked. I&#8217;ve gotten used to the rear dial, but it&#8217;s still a bit fiddly. Can&#8217;t do much about that though—and it doesn&#8217;t hugely impact the usability of the camera.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gordyscamerastraps.com/neck-string-double/index.htm">Gordy&#8217;s</a> strap (string; double attach; 50&#8221;) that I picked up for it is still going strong, too. Matches the X100 well and is just long enough to sling bandolier-style over my body—but long enough that I can still pull the viewfinder up to my eye comfortably.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still loving the OVF—even more as time goes on. I&#8217;m forever liking the frame-lines and what is effectively &#8220;greater than 100%&#8221; frame coverage. I do occasionally flick it over to the EVF if I really need to nail a composition—or shoot something close—but the other 90% of the time I&#8217;m using the OVF. It takes maybe a week to get used to the accuracy of the frame-lines vs. the distance of what you&#8217;re shooting (and therefore your composition)—but after that it&#8217;s smooth sailing.</p>

<p>The more time I spend with the X100 the more I know I made the right choice. There&#8217;s no buyer&#8217;s remorse here, despite considering the NEX-7 (unexciting RAW files; expensive with the 24mm), OM-D (too SLR-like), and the X-Pro 1 (just that bit too big). I can comfortably &#8220;see&#8221; in 35mm, which means I can almost frame a shot before lifting the camera to my eye. It&#8217;s never intrusive at dinner tables, in the car, or over my shoulder on long walks. It rarely struggles in less-than-ideal lighting, excels in good light, and gives me the control I want; all of these things are exactly what I was after. It&#8217;s almost a shame I waited so long to buy one.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First up: sorry for the slow updates. It&#8217;s been a busy couple of months. Saying that, I do have a trips to the Perth Royal Show, York &amp; New Norcia planned over the next couple of weeks, so expect more photos soon.</p>

<p>I also bought an iPhone 5 yesterday and recognised a dearth of usable wallpapers (1136px x 640px). I&#8217;ve since corrected that. You can grab this pack of four <a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/iphone5_wallpapers_20120925.zip">here</a>. I may go through my archives and add a few more, too.</p>
