    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Picked up another rangefinder—this time, a Yashica Electro 35 GSN. I discovered that my Minolta needed more than just new seals—it has a faulty self-timer that has jammed the shutter—and figured that was as good an excuse as any to add to my collection. I also wanted something that wasn&#8217;t going to fail me when I&#8217;m in Melbourne next month on holiday.</p>

<p>The Yashica itself is a little simpler than the Minolta, despite the busy-looking top plate. It&#8217;s aperture priority only, but will do anywhere between 1/500 and 30s. The viewfinder will show when the camera can&#8217;t keep the shutter in that range for the selected aperture, and the frame-lines are nice and bright. Looking forward to giving it a run this weekend.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I managed to score this Minolta Hi-Matic 9 for $60 on eBay a couple of weeks ago, and it arrived this Friday just past. The body is in great condition—with the odd few scratches you&#8217;d expect from something 50 years old—and it seems to have a working shutter (some of these Minolta&#8217;s have a rep for sticky shutters). The light seals are completely shot, so I&#8217;ll be replacing them this week with yarn &amp; felt, and I have a few rolls of Fuji 400H &amp; Ilford HP5 that should hopefully arrive shortly.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed that it works!</p>

    <link href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/alien-skin-exposure-vs-vsco-film/"/>
    <updated>2013-01-20T10:36:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/alien-skin-exposure-vs-vsco-film</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>During downtime or during periods where I&#8217;ve lacked a bit of motivation to go out and shoot, editing old photos and/or trying out some new post-processing techniques has often given me some inspiration to get out there again.</p>

<p>My process has always been fairly manual. Import into LR, fix any WB/exposure/highlight issues, apply a hand-crafted preset for some basic colour correction/vignetting/etc and then push the image into Photoshop + Alien Skin Exposure (&#8220;Exposure&#8221;) and apply a film preset. I typically set my preferred presets as actions in PS so I can hit a couple of keyboard shortcuts and end up back in Lightroom with a neatly stacked TIFF image on top of the original RAW one. It&#8217;s not the smoothest workflow, but the results are hard to beat.</p>

<p>Still, it&#8217;s always worth shopping around on occasion to see what else is out there. I&#8217;ve always been impressed by a lot of photographers who use VSCO Film, and decided to dedicate my Sunday morning to comparing VSCO&#8217;s film presets (VSCO 01 &amp; VSCO 02 for LR4) with Exposure&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Note that I have historically used Fuji Astia (color; I love the real thing) and Kodak Tri-X (B+W; great grain) emulations for most of my shots, but have been leaning towards Fuji 400H (a great neutral film) and Ilford HP5 (finer grain than Tri-X). Exposure and VSCO Film both have these on offer, so I&#8217;ve compared their Pro 400H, HP5, Tri-X and Provia 160VC emulations. Images were edited beforehand w/ WB/tint set identically. Any obvious differences in hue are the results of the emulation only. Large (1920px) versions are available if you click through—you&#8217;ll probably want to look at them if you want to examine the grain.</p>

<h4>Fuji 400H</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve really taken a liking to 400H recently—so much so that I bought a few rolls of the real stuff today (in 35mm format) with a near-mint Minolta Hi-Matic 9 rangefinder. It has such great tones, and I&#8217;ve had problems pulling myself away from a couple of <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/1084764@N20/pool/">Flickr</a> <a href="http://www.flickr.com/search/groups/?w=481987%40N24&amp;m=pool&amp;q=400H">group</a> pools.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_fuji_400h.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_fuji_400h_thumb.jpg" alt="Fuji 400H" /></a></p>

<p>Exposure definitely feels more vibrant here—the VSCO image has an odd tint to it.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_fuji_400h_2.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_fuji_400h_2_thumb.jpg" alt="Fuji 400H" /></a></p>

<p>This is a tough call. The VSCO image is slightly warmer (channeling some Portra, I feel) but Exposure&#8217;s rendition is a little more &#8220;honest&#8221;. The skin tones in Exposure&#8217;s take are definitely more natural.</p>

<h4>Portra 160VC</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve compared Portra 160VC as Exposure doesn&#8217;t have a Portra 400 emulation, and it&#8217;d be remiss to not include Portra given its popularity.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_portra_160vc.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_portra_160vc_thumb.jpg" alt="Portra 160VC" /></a></p>

<p>Big difference here. I feel the actual film <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/kodak_portra_160vc/pool/">lies somewhere in between</a>, as Exposure&#8217;s take is much more saturated.</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_portra_160vc_2.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_portra_160vc_2_thumb.jpg" alt="Portra 160VC" /></a></p>

<p>Exposure here, for sure. Looks more like Portra 160VC and has more &#8220;pop&#8221; to it.  The VSCO take isn&#8217;t bad though, and there&#8217;s no doubt plenty of people would prefer the less saturated take. I&#8217;m not huge on pushing saturation up, but I do like &#8220;enough&#8221;.</p>

<h4>Ilford HP5</h4>

<p>I&#8217;ve always had a tough time deciding between HP5 and Tri-X. HP5 is a bit finer grained, but Tri-X has great blacks. Note that the &#8220;original&#8221; Tri-X (which these emulations feel like) isn&#8217;t available anymore; Kodak changed the formula and re-branded it &#8220;400TX&#8221;. The grain is a tad finer in the new stuff, but I digress.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5_thumb.jpg" alt="Ilford HP5" /></a></p>

<p>Tricky. VSCO is brighter, but the Exposure take has better blacks. I&#8217;d say that the Exposure image could probably do with a slight exposure push to compensate a little more. The VSCO image doesn&#8217;t have nice grain (this is a problem with a number of their emulations; grain is very pattern-like).</p>

<hr />

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5_2.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_ilford_hp5_2_thumb.jpg" alt="Ilford HP5" /></a></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve compensated the Exposure shot a little—with a 10% opacity grey exclusion layer in PS—as VSCO gets to overwrite my own curve adjustments in Lightroom. It&#8217;s not a totally fair comparison as a result, but it lifts the blacks and really helps show the detail. VSCO&#8217;s black-and-white emulations are much flatter than real film, but this is also part of the attraction (and I like this look sometimes) for a lot of photographers. This could go either way, but I feel her eyes have more depth in Exposure&#8217;s take and the grain (again) is more organic.</p>

<h4>Kodak Tri-X</h4>

<p>It&#8217;s Tri-X. Most my black &amp; white work over the last six months uses this.</p>

<p><a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_trix_400.jpg"><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2013/ase_vs_vsco/ase_vsco_trix_400_thumb.jpg" alt="Kodak Tri-X" /></a></p>

<p>Again, it&#8217;s a tough call. <em>I</em> like the contrast in Exposure&#8217;s Tri-X emulation, and I think it&#8217;s much more like &#8221;<a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/tri-x/pool/">the real thing</a>&#8221;, but realism isn&#8217;t always the goal. VSCO&#8217;s grain here is actually (surprisingly) good for once, and I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s the pick of the VSCO crop.</p>

<h4>Wrap-up</h4>

<p>Exposure&#8217;s results are more pleasing to me, and in cases where I need to lift blacks or flatten things out I have more leeway to do so (that, and I&#8217;m already in Photoshop&#8230;). As aforementioned, it&#8217;s Exposure&#8217;s grain that really puts in ahead in my books: VSCO&#8217;s grain &#8220;scans&#8221; are too static. Many of us use film emulations for the grain, and nailing that is important.</p>

<p>Both are about the same price: Exposure is <a href="https://app.alienskin.com/store/">$199</a> and VSCO Film is <a href="http://visualsupply.co/store">$119 per pack</a>. Film 02 has updated Portra presets; Film 01 has Pro 400H and Tri-X (I&#8217;d buy 01, personally). VSCO has a neat little preset &#8220;toolkit&#8221; for tinting shadows, highlights and making other minor tweaks, and ultimately is more friendly to use as a result. Exposure has a <em>lot</em> of other emulations (Kodachrome!), and offers a lot of choice (too much?) for those who want that.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a tough call. VSCO really makes your workflow easy: fix first, hit the preset and tweak if needed. Exposure is a bit clunkier and you end up with 100MB+ TIFFs eating up some space (even if space is cheap these days), although Lightroom automatic stacking makes this a minor issue overall. But Exposure&#8217;s advantages—nicer grain, more natural saturation and more &#8220;pop&#8221; (however you quantify that)—outweigh the negatives.</p>

    <link href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/fuji-x100-three-months-in/"/>
    <updated>2012-10-04T08:07:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/fuji-x100-three-months-in</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&#8217;ve had the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eatsleeprepea-20">X100</a> for three months now, and I feel it&#8217;s time to add a few things to my <a href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/fuji-x100-review/">original review</a>. This review will be a little more technical than the first, but there (still) won&#8217;t be any pixel peeping here.</p>

<p>First up: the RAW files. They&#8217;re great, and there&#8217;s a <em>lot</em> of latitude in them. I pushed a bunch of files from the <a href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/say-anything/">Say Anything</a> gig I went to—which I shot at ISO3200—a minimum of one stop and saw very little chroma (colour) noise. What noise there was had a great &#8220;film&#8221; look, and pushing the files around with my usual Lightroom + Photoshop + Alien Skin Exposure workflow didn&#8217;t cause any problems. I&#8217;m still comfortably leaving the X100 set to ISO800/1000 on a daily basis (and using the ND filter to control shutter speed), without the need to worry about dull colours or ugly/distracting noise.</p>

<p>The battery life has been rock solid. There are some who seem to believe it has a sub-par battery life—and I guess if you&#8217;re coming from an pro-grade DSLR, then it may seem bad in comparison—but it manages weeks on standby with a good handful of shots in-between. It also coped with four days away when I went to <a href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/yallingup/">Yallingup</a> in July—the spare batteries I brought down with me never saw any use (it was still near-full almost a week later). It might be the fact that I review sparingly and spend most of my time using the OVF that contributes to this—I&#8217;m not the kind to &#8220;spray and pray&#8221;.</p>

<p>Reliability-wise, it hasn&#8217;t locked up once. I&#8217;ve had firmware v1.30 on it since day zero, so that may have something to do with it, but I&#8217;ve never had to pop the battery out to reset the camera. It&#8217;s almost managed to avoid any real dings or scratches, despite living sans-case in an inside pocket of my messenger bag. I have a JJC filter adapter ring and a <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/622143-REG/B_W_66_042015_66_042015_49mm_Digital_Pro.html">silver B+W UV filter</a> on it; I don&#8217;t use the hood as it adds too much depth. I not usually one to run with a UV filter on my cameras, but the X100 is the exception: it&#8217;s an every-day, always-there tool, and any damage to the lens means the whole camera is out of action. I just made sure to buy a decent filter to minimise any added ghosting or flare, and so far I haven&#8217;t had any problems.</p>

<p>The LCD could probably be a bit better (higher-res), and I have started to bump the AF mode dial on the front a bit more than I&#8217;d like. Part of that is attributed to the fact that it lives in my messenger bag (sans-case) and/or the cup-holder in my car, and therefore is outright more prone to being knocked. I&#8217;ve gotten used to the rear dial, but it&#8217;s still a bit fiddly. Can&#8217;t do much about that though—and it doesn&#8217;t hugely impact the usability of the camera.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.gordyscamerastraps.com/neck-string-double/index.htm">Gordy&#8217;s</a> strap (string; double attach; 50&#8221;) that I picked up for it is still going strong, too. Matches the X100 well and is just long enough to sling bandolier-style over my body—but long enough that I can still pull the viewfinder up to my eye comfortably.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still loving the OVF—even more as time goes on. I&#8217;m forever liking the frame-lines and what is effectively &#8220;greater than 100%&#8221; frame coverage. I do occasionally flick it over to the EVF if I really need to nail a composition—or shoot something close—but the other 90% of the time I&#8217;m using the OVF. It takes maybe a week to get used to the accuracy of the frame-lines vs. the distance of what you&#8217;re shooting (and therefore your composition)—but after that it&#8217;s smooth sailing.</p>

<p>The more time I spend with the X100 the more I know I made the right choice. There&#8217;s no buyer&#8217;s remorse here, despite considering the NEX-7 (unexciting RAW files; expensive with the 24mm), OM-D (too SLR-like), and the X-Pro 1 (just that bit too big). I can comfortably &#8220;see&#8221; in 35mm, which means I can almost frame a shot before lifting the camera to my eye. It&#8217;s never intrusive at dinner tables, in the car, or over my shoulder on long walks. It rarely struggles in less-than-ideal lighting, excels in good light, and gives me the control I want; all of these things are exactly what I was after. It&#8217;s almost a shame I waited so long to buy one.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First up: sorry for the slow updates. It&#8217;s been a busy couple of months. Saying that, I do have a trips to the Perth Royal Show, York &amp; New Norcia planned over the next couple of weeks, so expect more photos soon.</p>

<p>I also bought an iPhone 5 yesterday and recognised a dearth of usable wallpapers (1136px x 640px). I&#8217;ve since corrected that. You can grab this pack of four <a href="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/iphone5_wallpapers_20120925.zip">here</a>. I may go through my archives and add a few more, too.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Discovered a neat little waffle place called <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/338/1686816/restaurant/Perth/Superstar-Waffles-Northbridge">Superstar Waffles</a> here in Northbridge. Had a latte (good!) and shared a few bites from a waffle-on-a-stick with condensed milk (great!). I&#8217;m definitely a fan.</p>

<p>The store itself is very minimalist, from the iPad-as-the-till down to the spartan tables and chairs. It&#8217;s cozy, too, so plan to avoid usual busy periods or get something to go.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Decided we needed a weekend away after a busy first half of the year after balancing moving, study and work. We stayed at Yallingup Beach Holiday Park—Em&#8217;s favorite spot down in Yallingup—for three nights. It&#8217;s also 50m from the beach, which is just about as close as you can get without being in the ocean. Waking up to the crashing of waves was always a good way to start the day.</p>

<p>What did we get up to? In no particular order, we walked along the beach, took a few photos, ate cheese kranksy&#8217;s and hash browns, devoured the fruit bread and sourdough from the <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/348/1542382/restaurant/Western-Australia/Yallingup-Woodfired-Bakery-Dunsborough">Yallingup Woodfired Bakery</a>, and went for a quick drive in the winter cold to shoot some stars.</p>

<p>Not bad for two-and-a-half hours from Perth.</p>

    <link href="http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/fuji-x100-review/"/>
    <updated>2012-07-08T12:54:00+08:00</updated>
    <id>http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/fuji-x100-review</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>First up: this isn&#8217;t a technical, pixel peeping review—it is however a review about the user experience, handling and image character. If that floats your boat, read on.</p>

<p>So: I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eatsleeprepea-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0043RS864">Fuji X100</a> three weeks ago to replace my Panasonic GF1 + 20mm kit, which originally &#8220;replaced&#8221; my 5D Mark II + 35L. I was no longer worried about chasing paid work, and was instead just shooting street, editorial and landscapes for (mostly) myself. Having a camera that I could take <em>everywhere</em> (i.e. didn&#8217;t need its own bag) was a huge driving factor in getting the GF1, even if overall image quality wasn&#8217;t the same. It really didn&#8217;t matter though, and I ended up taking a ton of great photos with it. It did have its quirks—average AF, dynamic range/RAW files, and no viewfinder—but those were trade-offs I was willing to make. When the X100 came out, I wasn&#8217;t totally sold: I didn&#8217;t really read up on it and my GF1 wasn&#8217;t bugging me too much, so I keep shooting with what I had. But I kept running across amazing images from the X100, and the so-so RAW files from the GF1 (esp. compared with my old 5D2) were starting to grate just a little.</p>

<p>I sold my GF1 and lenses (I also had the 45mm f2.8 macro), waited for someone local to get stock, and bought the X100. And so far it&#8217;s been outstanding.</p>

<p>The optical viewfinder (OVF), first of all, rocks. It&#8217;s big, it&#8217;s clear, and the best part about it is that it covers <em>beyond</em> the frame, allowing you to spot people just outside your shot and wait for the right moment to hit the shutter. It&#8217;s also pretty customisable, although I&#8217;ve just stuck with the basic exposure information and the grid to keep things clean. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is also pretty decent, as far as these things go in today&#8217;s cameras, and you&#8217;ll need to flick over to it and activate &#8216;macro mode&#8217; if you want to shoot anything closer than 70cm/27in.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/x100-strip-1100.jpg" alt="X100 w/ Gordy's strap, viewfinder and on tripod" /></p>

<p>It fits well in your hand, with just enough &#8220;bulk&#8221; on the right to give you a grip on it, and there&#8217;s quick access to ISO (via the customisable Function button on top), aperture (with the ring on front) and exposure compensation (small dial on top) so you don&#8217;t have to dig through menus. I find it equal to a DSLR in that respect—there&#8217;s no digging through menus for the major controls. I&#8217;ve set the RAW button to toggle the in-built 3-stop ND filter—which is great if you either a) don&#8217;t want to stop down too much, or b) run with your settings dialled in for indoor scenes and quickly want to keep the shutter from maxing out with a single button press.</p>

<p>Most important of all, of course, are the images the X100 produces. The dynamic range is great, and highlights roll off smoothly. It can be a tad &#8220;soft&#8221; wide open, but there&#8217;s nothing really wrong with that—it can add character to some images. Things also sharpen up as soon as you stop down (f/2.8 onwards). It does like to flare, but it&#8217;s not harsh—to me, I think a bit of flare is welcome. And then there&#8217;s the fantastic way it handles noise. It&#8217;s not noiseless, but the noise it does exhibit is pleasant and I rarely need to apply <em>any</em> NR to images below ISO 3200. If I&#8217;m shooting above that, the shot is usually a candidate for black-and-white anyway. I&#8217;m usually happy to set this thing to aperture priority, f/4, ISO 1000 and -1/3 EV and go out shooting in the mornings and afternoons without the need to worry about grainy images or dull colours.</p>

<p>It has its quirks, but most of the major ones have been addressed—including AF performance, write speed and interface responsiveness—through firmware updates, so if you&#8217;re reading circa-December 2011 reviews, put less weight on those points. The quirks that do still exist aren&#8217;t even close to being deal-breakers: the rear control wheel is a bit fiddly, as is the &#8220;Menu/OK&#8221; button, and the command toggle (below the shutter dial) doesn&#8217;t work the same (or at all) in all VF modes. The newer (and bigger) X-Pro 1 addresses those things however, so at least we know Fuji is learning from their mistakes. The AF is &#8220;GF1 grade&#8221; to me, which is to say it&#8217;s capable if you&#8217;re familiar with contrast-detect AF systems. I don&#8217;t miss shots due to the AF, but it&#8217;s also not a camera built for tracking objects/shooting sports—you&#8217;re looking at the wrong camera if you need that.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also the mostly unanimous advice to use a 45MB/s SD card (or better) to keep shot-to-shot and image review speeds from being sluggish—I&#8217;m using a 16GB SanDisk Extreme (UHS-1), and don&#8217;t notice any particular issue there. I also bought two spare batteries and a wall+car charger (a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CRHM5C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eatsleeprepea-20&amp;linkCode=as2">Wasabi Power kit from Amazon for USD$23</a>), although I find I get a decent number of shots out of the camera (with power saving mode off) as it is.</p>

<p>Overall, I couldn&#8217;t ask for much more from a camera. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s expensive—you&#8217;re basically getting the image quality of a prosumer DSLR with a great prime in a <em>much</em> more portable package—and its handling allows the camera to get out the way and let you get on with making photographs.</p>
