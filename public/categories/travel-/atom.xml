    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Just came back from a quick four-day trip in Melbourne. The weather was great—having just missed the end of their heatwave—and we spent most of our time shopping, eating, walking &amp; taking photos. I'd been before (about four years ago), and it's easy to forget how much more "alive" the city is than Perth. Even at 8PM at night you're spoilt for choice, and not once do you feel unsafe walking down the streets between dinner and dessert.</p>

<p>The highlights were <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1721982/restaurant/Melbourne/Shawcross-Pizza-Fitzroy">Shawcross Pizza</a> in Fitzroy, who offered some of the best NY-style pizza we've had; <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1474868/restaurant/CBD/The-Hardware-Societe-Melbourne">The Hardware Societé</a> in the CBD, with an incredible chorizo &amp; tomato baked egg breakfast (Em had french toast w/ a poached pear &amp; hazelnut praline), and; <a href="http://www.urbanspoon.com/r/71/1631746/restaurant/CBD/Snag-Stand-Melbourne">The Snag Stand</a> with an amazing cheese kransky, sriracha mayonnaise &amp; cheese on brioche offering.</p>

<p>Fitzroy was (easily) our favorite place to eat and explore—you can walk forever and find new places you haven't seen or visited. We ended up taking cabs ($11 from the CBD) instead of trams there most of the time, and I think the next trip will have us staying in Fitzroy if we can manage it (but I think the next step is to move here!).</p>
