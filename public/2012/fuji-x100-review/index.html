      <h2>Fuji X100 Review</h2>
    



  <p>First up: this isn&#8217;t a technical, pixel peeping review—it is however a review about the user experience, handling and image character. If that floats your boat, read on.</p>

<p>So: I bought a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0043RS864/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eatsleeprepea-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0043RS864">Fuji X100</a> three weeks ago to replace my Panasonic GF1 + 20mm kit, which originally &#8220;replaced&#8221; my 5D Mark II + 35L. I was no longer worried about chasing paid work, and was instead just shooting street, editorial and landscapes for (mostly) myself. Having a camera that I could take <em>everywhere</em> (i.e. didn&#8217;t need its own bag) was a huge driving factor in getting the GF1, even if overall image quality wasn&#8217;t the same. It really didn&#8217;t matter though, and I ended up taking a ton of great photos with it. It did have its quirks—average AF, dynamic range/RAW files, and no viewfinder—but those were trade-offs I was willing to make. When the X100 came out, I wasn&#8217;t totally sold: I didn&#8217;t really read up on it and my GF1 wasn&#8217;t bugging me too much, so I keep shooting with what I had. But I kept running across amazing images from the X100, and the so-so RAW files from the GF1 (esp. compared with my old 5D2) were starting to grate just a little.</p>

<p>I sold my GF1 and lenses (I also had the 45mm f2.8 macro), waited for someone local to get stock, and bought the X100. And so far it&#8217;s been outstanding.</p>

<p>The optical viewfinder (OVF), first of all, rocks. It&#8217;s big, it&#8217;s clear, and the best part about it is that it covers <em>beyond</em> the frame, allowing you to spot people just outside your shot and wait for the right moment to hit the shutter. It&#8217;s also pretty customisable, although I&#8217;ve just stuck with the basic exposure information and the grid to keep things clean. The electronic viewfinder (EVF) is also pretty decent, as far as these things go in today&#8217;s cameras, and you&#8217;ll need to flick over to it and activate &#8216;macro mode&#8217; if you want to shoot anything closer than 70cm/27in.</p>

<p><img src="http://static.eatsleeprepeat.net/2012/x100-strip-1100.jpg" alt="X100 w/ Gordy's strap, viewfinder and on tripod" /></p>

<p>It fits well in your hand, with just enough &#8220;bulk&#8221; on the right to give you a grip on it, and there&#8217;s quick access to ISO (via the customisable Function button on top), aperture (with the ring on front) and exposure compensation (small dial on top) so you don&#8217;t have to dig through menus. I find it equal to a DSLR in that respect—there&#8217;s no digging through menus for the major controls. I&#8217;ve set the RAW button to toggle the in-built 3-stop ND filter—which is great if you either a) don&#8217;t want to stop down too much, or b) run with your settings dialled in for indoor scenes and quickly want to keep the shutter from maxing out with a single button press.</p>

<p>Most important of all, of course, are the images the X100 produces. The dynamic range is great, and highlights roll off smoothly. It can be a tad &#8220;soft&#8221; wide open, but there&#8217;s nothing really wrong with that—it can add character to some images. Things also sharpen up as soon as you stop down (f/2.8 onwards). It does like to flare, but it&#8217;s not harsh—to me, I think a bit of flare is welcome. And then there&#8217;s the fantastic way it handles noise. It&#8217;s not noiseless, but the noise it does exhibit is pleasant and I rarely need to apply <em>any</em> NR to images below ISO 3200. If I&#8217;m shooting above that, the shot is usually a candidate for black-and-white anyway. I&#8217;m usually happy to set this thing to aperture priority, f/4, ISO 1000 and -1/3 EV and go out shooting in the mornings and afternoons without the need to worry about grainy images or dull colours.</p>

<p>It has its quirks, but most of the major ones have been addressed—including AF performance, write speed and interface responsiveness—through firmware updates, so if you&#8217;re reading circa-December 2011 reviews, put less weight on those points. The quirks that do still exist aren&#8217;t even close to being deal-breakers: the rear control wheel is a bit fiddly, as is the &#8220;Menu/OK&#8221; button, and the command toggle (below the shutter dial) doesn&#8217;t work the same (or at all) in all VF modes. The newer (and bigger) X-Pro 1 addresses those things however, so at least we know Fuji is learning from their mistakes. The AF is &#8220;GF1 grade&#8221; to me, which is to say it&#8217;s capable if you&#8217;re familiar with contrast-detect AF systems. I don&#8217;t miss shots due to the AF, but it&#8217;s also not a camera built for tracking objects/shooting sports—you&#8217;re looking at the wrong camera if you need that.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s also the mostly unanimous advice to use a 45MB/s SD card (or better) to keep shot-to-shot and image review speeds from being sluggish—I&#8217;m using a 16GB SanDisk Extreme (UHS-1), and don&#8217;t notice any particular issue there. I also bought two spare batteries and a wall+car charger (a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005CRHM5C/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=eatsleeprepea-20&amp;linkCode=as2">Wasabi Power kit from Amazon for USD$23</a>), although I find I get a decent number of shots out of the camera (with power saving mode off) as it is.</p>

<p>Overall, I couldn&#8217;t ask for much more from a camera. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s expensive—you&#8217;re basically getting the image quality of a prosumer DSLR with a great prime in a <em>much</em> more portable package—and its handling allows the camera to get out the way and let you get on with making photographs.</p>
