## EATSLEEPREPEAT.NET

A fork of [Octopress](http://octopress.org) for [www.eatsleeprepeat.net](http://www.eatsleeprepeat.net), with:

- A hand-crafted theme using [Twitter Bootstrap](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) (under .themes/octocamp);
- Conditional sharing that works across the blog index and individual post pages, and;
- Some better caching tweaks (progress still to be made here!)

I currently deploy this on Heroku, and host the static media on Amazon Cloudfront.
